        text: `The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 
                At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth 
                (comparable to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar 
                System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite 
                in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any dwarf planet. 
                Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
                or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens E
                arth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon is classified as a p
                lanetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body, and lacks any significant atmosphere, 
                hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); 
                Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.`

        text: `Algebra is one of the broad areas of mathematics, 
                together with number theory, geometry and analysis. 
                In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for 
                manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.
                It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups,
                rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary 
                algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. 
                Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, 
                science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics.
                Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.`

        text: `Moles are small mammals adapted to a subterranean lifestyle (i.e., fossorial). 
        They have cylindrical bodies, velvety fur, very small, 
        inconspicuous ears and eyes, reduced hindlimbs, and short, 
        powerful forelimbs with large paws adapted for digging.
        The term mole is especially and most properly used for "true moles" of the family 
        Talpidae in the order Eulipotyphla, which are found in most parts of North America,
         Europe and Asia, although it may also refer to unrelated mammals of Australia 
         and southern Africa that have convergently evolved the "mole" body plan. The term 
         is not applied to all talpids; e.g., desmans and shrew moles differ from the common definition of "mole".`
